# simple-server (NOT)

*work in progress*

When working with REST client you will often find case when you need to test your mappings, or check how is your response parser working. And sometimes you need responses that you don't tipically obtain from the testing API servers. So I'm building this server that will serve mock responses that you can configure to better suit your needs.
